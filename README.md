# VGG16-FCN8-Semantic-Segmentation

This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) for semantic segmentation. The model architecture utilizes VGG16 as an encoder and FCN8 as a decoder.

## Code Overview

### 1. Convolution Block Function

The `block` function in the code defines a block containing several convolutional layers followed by a pooling layer. This function is used to construct the VGG16 encoder.

### 2. VGG16 Encoder

The `VGG_16` function creates the VGG16 encoder model by stacking multiple convolution blocks with varying parameters.

### 3. FCN8 Decoder

The `fcn8_decoder` function defines the FCN8 decoder, which upsamples the output from the encoder and combines it with features from different stages to generate the final segmentation.

### 4. Segmentation Model

The `segmentation_model` function assembles the complete segmentation model by connecting the VGG16 encoder and FCN8 decoder.

## Usage

To use the segmentation model, instantiate it using the `segmentation_model` function and compile it with an appropriate optimizer and loss function. You can then train the model on your dataset or use it for inference.

```python
# Example usage
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model
model = segmentation_model()

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model or use it for inference
# ...
```

## Note

Make sure to download the pretrained weights for the VGG16 model before using the code. You can load the weights using the `load_weights` method, as shown in the code.

```python
# Load VGG16 pretrained weights
!wget https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases/download/v0.1/vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5

vgg_weights_path = "vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5"
```

Feel free to customize the code according to your requirements and experiment with different hyperparameters.
